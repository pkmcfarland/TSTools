# Rules for constructing file:
# 1.) all blank lines and all lines starting with # will be skipped
# 2.) columns are white-space separated, amount of white space does not matter
# 3.) events do not need to be in chronological order
# 4.) a break is a point in the time series where there is an instantaneous change,
#     the break can be due to an earthquake, an equipment change, or similar event.
#     In this document, a 'break record' is all of the information required to 
#     describe to TSTools how to handle the break. See below for more information.
# 5.) start new break record with +, end break record with -
# 6.) break record values other than those associated with time of break can have 
#     either:
#     999 => include as a parameter to be estimated
#       0 => do not include this parameter at all
#     any other value assigns that value to the parameter and fixes it in the
#     inversion
# 7.) a break record can have either 2 or 9 lines. No other options are possible.
# 8.) if a break record has only two lines the columns for the lines are:
#     
#     line #1:
#     01 +        start new record
#     02 YYYY     4-digit year    (int)
#     03 MM       2-digit month   (int)
#     04 DD       2-digit day     (int)
#     05 HH       2-digit hour    (int)
#     07 MN       2-digit minute  (int)
#     08 SS.SS    decimal seconds (float)
#     09          magnitude of x1 offset (m)
#     10          magniutde of x2 offset (m)
#     11          magnitude of x3 offset (m)
#
#     line #2:
#     01 -        end of record
#
# 9.) if a break record has 9 lines the format for the record is:
#
#     line #1:
#     same as first line in 2-line record
#
#     line #2:
#     01          change in x1 component of velocity (m/yr)
#     02          change in x2 component of velocity (m/yr)
#     03          change in x3 comopnent of velocity (m/yr)
#
#     line #3:
#     01          magnitude of first exp x1 term (m)
#     02          magnitude of second exp x1 term (m)
#     03          magnitude of third exp x1 term (m)
#     04          relaxation time of first exp x1 term (yrs)
#     05          relaxation time of second exp x1 term (yrs)
#     06          relaxation time of third exp x1 term (yrs)
#
#     line #4:
#     same as line #3 but for x2
#
#     line #5:
#     same as line #3 but for x3
#
#     line #6:
#     01          magnitude of ln x1 term (m)
#     02          relaxation time of ln x1 term (yrs)
#
#     line #7:
#     same as line #5 but for x2
#
#     line #8:
#     same as line #5 bur for x3
#
#     line #9:
#     01 -        end record
       
# 10.) If coord.s in dEdNdU x1 = E, x2 = N, x3 = U
#                    dXdYdZ x1 = X, x2 = Y, x3 = Z
